## Hi there, I am Kathleen! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a final-year Information Technology student specializing in Computer Networking and Security at Sunway University. My passion lies in cybersecurity, particularly in cryptography and ethical hacking, and I'm always eager to explore the latest advancements in these areas.

Throughout my academic journey, I've gained hands-on experience in various network security tools and have developed a solid foundation in both technical skills and team collaboration. 
Beyond my technical interests, I have a creative side that I express through dance and music, having been actively involved in dance competitions and performances during my school years.

I'm excited to connect with like-minded professionals and explore opportunities where I can contribute my skills and continue learning.
